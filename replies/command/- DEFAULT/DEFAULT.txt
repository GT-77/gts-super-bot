-
The fog has trapped my vision completely, I cannot handle it anymore.
Every time I look out the window all I see is grey.
I am starving for change.
Even seeing black would do.
All I want is to just feel something.
今日死んだらどうする？
I bet you would do nothing.
I don't even know what I'm doing.
Nothing is in my control.
I don't hate you because I cannot even feel for you, I don't even want to understand what you are.
